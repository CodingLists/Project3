Project 3



INTRO


Project 3 was an impeccable labyrinth that allowed me, and I assume 
the rest of my fellow coding comrades, an oppurtunity to explore the
possible challenges that we might face some time in the perhaps near
future. We were assigned a relatively short task to tackle, but there 
is no cadence of completion unless a puzzle was thrown out in our path.
The instructions we were provided prevented us from doing a copy paste
"follow along project." I myself enjoyed this intruiging for a change. Sometimes
during the labs it seems we are just copying out code from a JAVADOC. 
Here since we weren't accompanied by very much assistance in the write-
up, it was more of us being handed an end goal, and trying to figure out 
a way to get there with almost 0 guidence, and it seems like I got there.



MESO AVERAGE


The first quest on my journey was to slay the public class that is MesoAscii.
I don't neccesarily understand what Ascii means, nevertheless, the Abstarct class
gave me some pointers on what to do since the writeup did not. It was simply another
avergager which I have plenty of practice under my utility belt from previous labs and
personal works I have created. The MesoAscii class required a constructor of a MesoStation,
which thankfully was provided to us. I had a MesoStation as a private instance variable and
initilized it in the consructor. Next came the only method the class had to offer. I took
four characters and took the average of their values. 



SORT AND PASTE


The final class on my bucketlist was something that sounds similar to Mexico. Lexicographical. This class had
a constructor and a method which inherits from a parent class called MesoSortedAbstract. I spent a good 
portion of my duration on this part of the project doing something completley useless. I tried several different
unique ways to go about sorting a HashMap. None of them worked and I will not go into details about any of them,
but I ended up learning about TreeMaps which actually just sort the Map for you. I created a TreeMap in the sorted
method of this class and sorted my HashMap that I made in MesoEquals. Now that I had the sorted version of all of
the MesoStations with a certain Integer of average I called that method in the constructor, and printed it all out
using an enhanced For Loop. I really wish I knew more about TreeMaps.
