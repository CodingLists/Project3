Project 3



INTRO


Project 3 was an impeccable labyrinth that allowed me, and I assume 
the rest of my fellow coding comrades, an oppurtunity to explore the
possible challenges that we might face some time in the perhaps near
future. We were assigned a relatively short task to tackle, but there 
is no cadence of completion unless a puzzle was thrown out in our path.
The instructions we were provided prevented us from doing a copy paste
"follow along project." I myself enjoyed this intruiging for a change. Sometimes
during the labs it seems we are just copying out code from a JAVADOC. 
Here since we weren't accompanied by very much assistance in the write-
up, it was more of us being handed an end goal, and trying to figure out 
a way to get there with almost 0 guidence, and it seems like I got there.



MESO AVERAGE


The first quest on my journey was to slay the public class that is MesoAscii.
I don't neccesarily understand what Ascii means, nevertheless, the Abstarct class
gave me some pointers on what to do since the writeup did not. It was simply another
avergager which I have plenty of practice under my utility belt from previous labs and
personal works I have created. The MesoAscii class required a constructor of a MesoStation,
which thankfully was provided to us. I had a MesoStation as a private instance variable and
initilized it in the consructor. Next came the only method the class had to offer. I took
four characters and took the average of their values.
